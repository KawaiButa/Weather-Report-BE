1. npm run build <br>
2. **Run the server**<br>
For local run: node ./dist/index.js <br>
For testing with firebase emulator: firebase emulators:start --only functions<br>
Note: With the testing environment firebase emulator only functions, the server will only run locally so that it cannot access to any other services of the firebase that is used in the project. In order to test all the API with firebase emulator, run firebase emulators:start instead of firebase emulators:start --only functions.
